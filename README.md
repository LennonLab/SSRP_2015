**Dimensions: Collaborative Research: Microbial seed banks: processes and patterns of dormancy-driven biodiversity**

This repository contains open-source code, data, & text files for an SSRP project related to a National Science Foundation Dimensions of Biodiversity grant (#1442246) awarded to Dr.'s Jay Lennon and Ken Locey of Indiana University (Bloomington) and to Dr. Stuart Jones of the University of Notre Dame (#...).

### Repo Contents

The `data` folder contains plate-reader output from EcoPlate experiments.
Each `.txt` file respresents a single 96-well plate (8 rows, 12 columns), 'tab' separated values. 
Each well is an absorbance reading at 590 nm, which corresponds to the utilization of 
a specific resource in the corresponding well of the resource matrix (`ecoplate.info/resource_matrix.txt`).
Resources are distributed on plates in triplicate (cols 1-4 repeated three times).

The `bin` folder contains scripts for parsing relevant info from a `.txt` file generated by the plate-reader software (`bin/ecoplate_parser.R`).
This script takes the raw output of the plate reader (as a `.txt` file), and writes another tab-separated
`.txt` file into the same folder, with `_parsed` appended to the original filename.
