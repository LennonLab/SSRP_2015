To make plots in R, we use the function ***plot()***. 
There are any number of parameters that you can use to set up the graph you want to make, but you should think about what best describes your data.

```{r}

#Scatter plots

x <- 
y <-
  
plot(x, y, 
     xlim = c(,), ylim = c(,),              # specifiy your plot range
     type = , pch = , lwd = , col = "",     # specify what you want your plot to look like
     xlab = list("", cex = 1.5, font = 2),  # label the x-axis
     ylab = list("", cex = 1.5, font = 2),  # label the y-axis            
     cex = 20, cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.15 # change the sizes
     )

```
